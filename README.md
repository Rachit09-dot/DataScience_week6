📈 Commodity Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict commodity prices (Gold) using historical market data.
The model is developed using Python and executed in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

🎯 Objective

To predict the closing price of gold based on market parameters such as:

Open price

High price

Low price

Trading volume

📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle

Dataset Name: Gold Price Prediction Dataset

Format: CSV

File Used: gold_price_data.csv

The dataset contains historical gold price information with multiple attributes.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Visual Studio Code

⚙️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repository or download the files

Install required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn


Open the folder in VS Code

Run the Python file:

python linear_regression_gold.py

🧠 Methodology

Import required libraries

Load and explore the dataset

Handle missing values

Select features and target variable

Split data into training and testing sets

Train Linear Regression model

Evaluate model using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared (R²) score

Visualize actual vs predicted prices

📊 Model Evaluation

Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to measure prediction error

R² Score is used to measure model accuracy

Scatter plot visualizes actual vs predicted prices

✅ Results

The Linear Regression model successfully predicts gold prices with reasonable accuracy, demonstrating that linear regression can be effectively used for commodity price prediction on structured datasets.

📌 Conclusion

This project shows how machine learning techniques like Linear Regression can be applied to real-world financial data to make predictions. The approach is simple, efficient, and suitable for academic assignments.
